    <p> While we was passing through a temple we heard Gods talking abt something.
      We thereby stopped to listen them. <br>
      And what we overhead was something which seems very alluring to our brain and was very restricted. <br>The
      talk was abt a person who is a part of our life,<br> who has the rights to give us all the pain and take
      away all our happening.<br>
      And on your 20th Birthday we have been given this opportunity to unwrap all your positive, all your love for
      yourself ,<br> and your happiness so that any day in your life after reading this you will never doubt on
      your goodness.
      <br>Okay soo
      Firstly
      WISH YOU A VERY VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY "OUR LIMITLESS"<br>
      Ohhhhh..
      Now u are thinking why we are calling u limitless today, becoz abhi tk PP tha na. <br>
      Okay so hear us out what we heard abt you and plannings of destiny for u. <br>

      Did you ever try to look into yourself? <br>

      Like for once.<br>
      Your name itself suggest you can't be stopped by anyone in this fucking world. <br>
      Do you even realise the amount of talent u have. <br>
      And do u want to hear what we love the most??
      Guess guesss<br>
      .. <br>
      .. <br>
      .. <br>
      ..
      It's your Helping nature and unending love for us.<br>
      Yes this is a talent. <br>
      Becoz everyone is not so blessed to give that they have this in nature. <br>
      But sometimes u disappoint us. <br>
      And we were shocked to hear this that gods are also disappointed by this habit of yours. <br>
      Can u remember? <br>
      ..
      . .
      ..
      <br>Comeon, think harder! <br>
      .
      .
      IT IS ALWAYS DOUBTING ON YOURSELF AND YOUR POTENTIAL. <br>
      Aditi we know u from our school days. <br>
      We have seen u become a grown up girl from this childish girl shedding tears all time. <br>
      You have faced difficult times and has managed to come out of it. <br>
      You have always been a FIGHTER. <br>
      U never gave up anytime. <br>
      Then why u have started doubting on yourself? <br>
      Why do u think, people don't like u? <br>
      Why do u think, they will not love u for what u r. <br>
      And why do u think that u will never find a person who will love u with all your flaws also. <br>
      Girl u are made to shine<br>
      U r made to excel<br>
      U made to help people
      And u are made to give love in this loveless world.<br>
      U have immense potential. <br>
      U can get whatever u want
      And give whatever u wish to. <br>
      U are a bird who has got this limitless sky to fly in.<br>
      U have this quality to think for everyone's happiness. <br>
      Then can u just imagine<br>
      THE AMOUNT OF HAPPINESS U CAN GIVE TO YOURSELF.<br>
      Please stop doubting on yourself. <br>
      Please get out from all u r trapped in.<br>
      Get a bit more stronger<br>
      Stop shedding tears deep inside.<br>
      YOU DESERVE FAR MORE BETTER THAN WHAT U HAVE RIGHT NOW<br>
      IN ALL FUCKING TERMS. <br>
      START INVESTING IN YOURSELF.<br>
      START LOVING YOURSELF TO NEXT LEVEL.<br>
      YOU ARE STEPPING IN YOUR 20'S NOW. <br>
      And we always want to see u as a STRONG POWERFUL WOMEN. <br>
      Who not only can deal with all the daily issues of life but can balance bw emotional and mental stress to.
      <br>
      Becoz you are grown up now. <br>
      U r 20 NOW
      We thought of telling u this msg which we overhead.<br>
      They believe the same. <br>
      THEY SAY DO WHATEVER U WANT, BUT DO IT RIGHT<br>
      DO IT WITH ALL YOUR HARD WORK. <br>
      THEY ARE ALWAYS STANDING BESIDE YOU. <br>
      This is the right time for u to know this.<br>
      THAT U CAN DO WHATEVER U WANT<br>
      U CAN FLY AS HIGH AS U WANT. <br>
      U CAN BREAK ALL THE RECORDS. <br>
      U CAN BE ZENITH IN YOUR FIELD. <br>
      JUST START BELIEVING IN YOURSELF<br>
      You are the most loved and amazing human being we have met. <br>
      HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY ADITI. <br>
      We hope this frndship turns better every day older. <br>
      God ne toh bless krdiya hai apko<br>
      Bas abh aap khudko bless kro<br>
      Aur hamesha khus raho<br>
      Stay always happy baby<br>
      U always got our backs. <br>
      Celebrate your day like a bang.<br>
      May u grow every day. <br>
      Lots and lots of love for u baby. <br>
    </p>
